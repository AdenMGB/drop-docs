# Getting started with Drop
Drop clients are available for download from the [our website](https://droposs.org/download). Download the correct version for your platform, and open it up.

The client will walk you through the setup and sign-in process to get started. You'll need a Drop instance you can connect to, and an account on the server. If you don't have one, you can follow the [Quickstart guide](/docs/guides/quickstart) to setup your own.
